I'm an Ireland based Cloud Computing enthusiast, who has worked on several technologies for the last four years. Independent and self-motivated,
with a track record of learning new technologies rapidly and going the additional mile to help others.

Currently in the final semester of Masters in Cloud Computing at [National College of Ireland](https://www.ncirl.ie/).
Apart from studies, I am writing technical blogs on my own website [YouCompetent](https://www.youcompetent.com).
