In this project we have not used any API to get the market data, instead, we created a few random stocks and functionally act as an actual stock market. This will guide the beginner or an investor to jump into the stock market and analyze their profits and losses. This web application is a simulation of the trading activity, where the graph of the share is viewable. Also, after successful buying and selling of the stock, usersâ€™ holdings would be updated accordingly in graphical format. Because of this, the user can analyze the performance of his trading activity in a share market simulation.
