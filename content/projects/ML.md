we have implemented a time series forecasting Projection which makes scientific predictions based on historical time stamped data. We have devised a number of algorithms like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Prophet Model, Pattern Evaluation to accurately forecast the future of the pandemic. The project displays the data in form of graphs and charts making it more meaningful and understandable. This information is of essential importance for pandemic planning and mitigation strategies.
