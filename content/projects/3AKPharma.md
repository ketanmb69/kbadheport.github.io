The  web application  makes  use  of  a  publicly  available  REST-API named Auth0 for authentication and self-developed API foraccess management. We have deployed our web application on  Amazon  Web  services  AWS  Beanstalk  platform  and have  also  provisioned  a  full  life-cycle  CICD  pipeline  for the purpose of quick delivery and deployment of changes.
