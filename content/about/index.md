Hello All! I am a technology enthusiast and I am currently pursuing my Masters in Cloud Computing at [National College of Ireland,  Dublin,  Ireland](https://www.ncirl.ie/). Before that I worked as a Technology Integration Engineer for 3 years at **Amdocs, India**. I can say that I got introduced to beginner level of programming in my 1st year at [Terna Engineering College, Navi Mumbai](https://ternaengg.ac.in/) where I completed my Bachelors in Computer Engineering (2014-2018).

At this moment as a Cloud Computing student, I have a great hands-on on most of  the AWS services, where I used to develop web applications and similarly deployed the same on cloud deployment provides such as Elastic Beanstalk, CodeDeploy and AWS Lambda.
More interestingly, I am working on my thesis topic "Traversing Serverless Computing with Elastic File System to Deploy Large Deep Learning Model for Inference." In this project, I am proposing a methodology and architecture to use deep learning to train a model consisting of a multi-label prediction dataset using an optimizing algorithm named Adam to classifythe tags and predict the relevant tags based on the input. 

I'm also an [Technical Blogger](https://www.youcompetent.com) where I share the knowledge of the technologies I am familiar with and provide the resources too.


Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
